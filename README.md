# Sleep-segmentation
Sleep segmentation using BiLSTM

# Method
The present work shows the usages of BiLSTM to classify the 4 sleep stages wake, core, deep and REM.
There are 3 versions of the BiLSTM:
1. Simple Bi-LSTM model
2. Simple Bi-LSTM model with undersampling label 1
3. Simple Bi-LSTM model with feature engineering
